# MLP or Vanila GAN & DCGAN
#### Trained with NVIDIA P100 GPU

#### Data
- MINIST

#### Training
- GAN:
  * Used only Linear Layers (MLP) to create MNIST 
  * [Paper Link by Ian J. Goodfellow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- DCGAN:
  * Used Convolution and Tranposed Convolution
  * [Paper by Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala (Link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434)

#### Result
- GAN:
  * From the beginning, the noises are just noises but after few epochs, it starts to learn how to fake the discriminator.

- DCGAN:
  * Unlike Valina GAN, DCGAN produces more clear and less noise output at the end.

#### Conclusion
GAN was devloped only five years ago. There are numerous GANs so I will keep study them until I get the new idea.
