## Intro

* I built every transaction and database from the scratch. Initially, this company used Spring(Java) but due to poor documentation, making from the scratch was the best choice at that time.
* PostgreSQL, Django are used. At the end, this company could raise Series A and keep doing well.
* _Before I joined the team, they used an excel file, which takes more than one minute to open, to manage their data._ :(
